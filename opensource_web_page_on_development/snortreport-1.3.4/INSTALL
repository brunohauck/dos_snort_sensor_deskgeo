DESCRIPTION
Snort Report is an add-on module for the Snort Intrusion Detection System.
It provides real-time reporting from the MySQL or PostgreSQL database generated
by Snort.


INSTALLATION
We recommend visiting http://www.symmetrixtech.com for the latest detailed Snort and
Snort Report installation guides.  The information below is just general information. 

1.  Requirements:
	a.  Operating System -  Snort Report will work on most systems running
		Apache and PHP.  It has been tested on many flavors of Linux,
		Mac OSX, and Windows. 
	b.  Database - Currently, only MySQL 4.x and PostgreSQL are supported.
	    Earlier or later versions of MySQL should work but are untested.  The newer
	    versions of Postgre may not work - patches are appreciated!  A database
	    abstraction layer has now been added to Snort Report so it should be
	    trivial to add support for Oracle, ODBC, etc, if anyone's interested.
	c.  Snort Intrusion Detection System - http://www.snort.org
	    Only version 2.9.5 is supported.  Earlier versions may work with SR but
	    they have not been tested.
	d.  Web server -  Apache 1.3, 2.0, and PHP 5 (earlier versions may work)

2.  Installing Snort Report
	a.  Unzip the files into a directory on your web server.
	b.  Edit srconf.php to enable Snort Report to see your MySQL server and
	    Snort database.
	c.  That's it!  Load alerts.php into your web browser.


PERFORMANCE
1.  Please see Performance.txt (included with this distribution) for tips on
    speeding up Snort Report with MySQL.
2.  You may also see slight speed improvements by installing the PHP Optimizer,
    available at http://www.zend.com.


TROUBLESHOOTING
1.  Make sure PHP is configured properly with all the support you need to run
    Snort Report.  Create a PHP file with <?phpinfo();?> in it and load it
    into your web browser to see all the configured modules.
2.  If you think you have a genuine bug, please let us know by email at
    snortreport@symmetrixtech.com.  Sorry, but we don't provide support for
    installing Apache, PHP, etc.  Check out the vendor's website for help.
